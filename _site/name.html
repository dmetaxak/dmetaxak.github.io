                        <h1>To Ë or not to É&hellip;</h1>

<p>Since transitioning, I&rsquo;ve been debating changing my name, because my birth name (first and last), while gender-neutral to most non-Greeks, is feminine in the Greek language. That name, Δανάη, is often transliterated to English as &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danaë">Danaë</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>For years already, my family has called me the masculine form of that name, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danaus">Δαναός</a>. Seems like an obvious choice to start using in English, right? Here&rsquo;s where it gets a little complicated.</p>

<p>Greek grammar has &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_case">cases</a>&rdquo; (if you studied Ancient Greek or Latin you may remember the concept). For example, when you address someone directly (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocative_case#Greek">vocative case</a>), you conjugate their name from its base form. For someone named Nikos, you&rsquo;d address him &ldquo;hey, Niko!&rdquo; (no S on the end). For the name Δαναός, the name you&rsquo;d use is Δαναέ (Danaé).</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s how we got here! A few more questions you might have:</p>

<p>Why not go by Danaos?</p>
<ul>
  <li>In short, personal preference. I do, in Greek. But in English it seems silly to change my name more substantialy, only to have people addressing me in a way that sounds wrong to my ear. I also don&rsquo;t want to change (masculinize) my last name for many reasons, and I personally don&rsquo;t like the way the combination (Danaos + Metaxa) looks ungrammatical to me. Plus I just don&rsquo;t like how it sounds in English. In any case, this choice is actually quite common; any Greeks you know named Dimitri, Niko, Angelo, etc. (in other words, most masculine Greek names that don&rsquo;t have the final S) are doing this same grammatical trick.</li>
</ul>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t Danaé Metaxa still look like a feminine name to someone who speaks Greek?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Maybe, yeah; I kind of like the ambiguity. But maybe this will feel super awkward in practice, when I meet other Greeks in English-speaking settings. This brings us to the next point:</li>
</ul>

<p>Why not change my name to something entirely different?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Who knows, I still might! But it&rsquo;s an administrative hassle (legal paperwork, amending old publications), it&rsquo;s an interpersonal hassle (everyone getting used to the change, colleagues keeping track of my name/work), it&rsquo;s expensive, and I like my name in Greek quite a lot. So I&rsquo;m going to try this out first, and see how it goes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Perhaps the most important one: how do I pronounce your name?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unless you&rsquo;re Greek and can say Δαναέ, you can pronounce it as always: &ldquo;da-nah-AY&rdquo; or, said quickly/for ease of memory, something like &ldquo;deny&rdquo; (the verb/like the river in Egypt). My pronouns in English are still they/them, and in Greek are ο/του.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for your interest!</p>
