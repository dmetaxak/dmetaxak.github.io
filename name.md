# To Ë or not to É...

Since transitioning, I've been debating changing my name, because my birth name (first and last), while gender-neutral to most non-Greeks, is feminine in the Greek language. That name, Δανάη, is often transliterated to English as "[Danaë][wikidanae]".

For years already, my family has called me the masculine form of that name, [Δαναός][wikidanaos]. Seems like an obvious choice to start using in English, right? Here's where it gets a little complicated. 

Greek grammar has "[cases][wikicases]" (if you studied Ancient Greek or Latin you may remember the concept). For example, when you address someone directly (the [vocative case][wikivocative]), you conjugate their name from its base form. For someone named Nikos, you'd address him "hey, Niko!" (no S on the end). For the name Δαναός, the name you'd use is Δαναέ (Danaé). 

So that's how we got here! A few more questions you might have:

Why not go by Danaos?
- In short, personal preference. I do, in Greek. But in English it seems silly to change my name more substantialy, only to have people addressing me in a way that sounds wrong to my ear. (Though every other Greek guy whose name ends in S is also putting up with this, so it's not a huge deal.) I also don't want to change (masculinize) my last name for many reasons, and I personally don't like the way the combination (Danaos + Metaxa) looks ungrammatical. Plus I just don't like how it sounds in English. 

Doesn't Danaé Metaxa still look like a feminine name to someone who speaks Greek?
- Maybe, yeah; I kind of like the ambiguity. But maybe this will feel super awkward in practice, when I meet other Greeks in English-speaking settings. This brings us to the next point:

Why not change my name to something entirely different?
- Who knows, I still might! But it's an administrative hassle (legal paperwork, amending old publications), it's an interpersonal hassle (everyone getting used to the change, colleagues keeping track of my name/work), it's expensive, and I like my name in Greek quite a lot. So I'm going to try this out first, and see how it goes. 

Perhaps the most important one: how do I pronounce your name?
- Unless you're Greek and can say Δαναέ, you can pronounce it as always: "deny" (like the verb/the river in Egypt). My pronouns in English are still they/them, and in Greek are ο/του. 

Thanks for your interest!
