Danaé Metaxa is Raj and Neera Singh Term Assistant Professor at the University of Pennsylvania in the [Computer and Information Science department][penncis], with a secondary appointment in the [Annenberg School for Communication][pennasc]. Dr. Metaxa is co-founder (along with [Andrew Head][amh]) of the [Penn HCI group][pennhci], and executive committee member of Penn's [Center for Media, Technology, and Democracy][center].

In their research, Dr. Metaxa studies **bias and representation in algorithmic systems and content**, focusing on high-stakes social settings like politics, employment, and advertising, and on marginalized groups. 
<!-- Recently, their group has been developing [**sociotechnical auditing**][sta], an algorithm/AI auditing method that combines traditional auditing with user-centered behavioral science interventions, to understand how algorithmic systems and their end users impact each other. -->

Prior to joining Penn, Dr. Metaxa received a Ph.D. in [Computer Science][stanfordCS] at Stanford University, working in the [Stanford HCI Group][hci] and the [Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society's][pacs] [Program on Democracy and the Internet][pdi].
