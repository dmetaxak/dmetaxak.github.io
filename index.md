DanaÃ« Metaxa is Raj and Neera Singh Term Assistant Professor at the University of Pennsylvania in the [Computer and Information Science department][penncis], with a secondary appointment in the [Annenberg School for Communication][pennasc]. Along with [Andrew Head][amh], they are the co-founder and co-leader of the [Penn HCI group][pennhci]. 

In their research, Dr. Metaxa studies **bias and representation in algorithmic systems and content**, focusing on high-stakes social settings like politics and employment, and on marginalized groups. Recently, their group has been developing [**sociotechnical auditing**][sta], an algorithm/AI auditing method that combines traditional auditing with user-centered behavioral science interventions, to understand how algorithmic systems and their end users impact each other.

Prior to joining Penn, Dr. Metaxa was a postdoctoral scholar with the Stanford [Center of Philanthropy and Civil Society's][pacs] [Program on Democracy and the Internet][pdi], and a Ph.D. candidate in [Computer Science][stanfordCS] at Stanford University.
